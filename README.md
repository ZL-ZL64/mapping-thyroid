The thyroid in hyperthyroidism undergoes enormous growth and represents considerable variability in the anatomical position of the enlarged thyroid. Knowledge of the substantial anatomic variation is fundamental for the disease’s accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, the pathological anatomy of the thyroid location following the alteration of its size is absent. Therefore, a long-term model we well-established for human Graves´ disease, was employed and sized into varying phases. We blended the registered thyroids to produce site-dependent incidence graphs of thyroid in each phase and thyroid phase-dependent topography. The depicted graphs illustrate the fine localization of the thyroid in various sizes and their dynamic changes during enlargement. Hopefully, the macropathological anatomy we presented may facilitate currently used fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonography-guided biopsy techniques.
